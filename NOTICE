================================================================================

This plugin was inspired by concepts from the following project:

bkit (Vibecoding Kit)

Specifically, Dev Squad's development pipeline structure was influenced by
bkit's PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) methodology for AI-native development.

Dev Squad does not contain copied code from bkit. All agents, skills, and
workflows are original implementations. The influence is limited to:
- Document organization patterns (plan → implementation → QA verification)
- Phased development pipeline concept
- Quality gate methodology
