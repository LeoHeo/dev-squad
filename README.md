**Ship production-ready features with a team of 6 AI agents — not a single overwhelmed one.**

> **One command. Six specialists. Production-ready code.**

```bash
/new-feature
```

```
🔍 Detecting project... Spring Boot + Nuxt 3 (monorepo)
👔 CTO Lead      → Breaking down requirements into 4 tasks
🎨 Frontend Sr.  → "I need the API contract for /api/users"
⚙️ Backend Sr.   → "Here's the spec: GET /api/users → UserListResponse"
🎨 Frontend Sr.  → "Got it, building the table component now"
🛡️ Security Sr.  → "Found: missing @PreAuthorize on PUT endpoint"
⚙️ Backend Sr.   → "Fixed, added hasAuthority('PERM_USER_EDIT')"
🧪 QA Sr.        → "All 12 scenarios passed, 0 failures"
👔 CTO Lead      → "Requirements match rate: 96%. Ship it."
✅ 4 commits created on feature/user-management
```

*This is what happens when you stop asking one agent to do six jobs.*

### Real Session Capture

This is an actual Dev Squad session — CTO Lead orchestrating 6 agents working in parallel via tmux:

## The Problem

When a single AI agent builds a feature end-to-end, it:

- **Loses context** switching between frontend, backend, and infrastructure
- **Skips security review** because it wrote the code itself (self-review bias)
- **Misses edge cases** in QA because it already "knows" what the code does
- **Drifts from spec** with no one to catch deviations in real time

Research shows single-agent development catches only **39% of defects** before deployment, and **52% of generated code requires rework** due to missed requirements or integration bugs.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/comparison.svg" alt="Single Agent vs Agent Teams" width="800"/>
</p>

## The Solution

**Dev Squad** assigns 6 specialized agents — each with deep expertise and a clear role — that collaborate in real time via `SendMessage`, just like a real development team.

| Agent | Role | What It Does |
|-------|------|-------------|
| **CTO Lead** | Orchestrator | Breaks down requirements, assigns tasks, validates results. Never writes code. |
| **Frontend Sr.** | UI Engineer | Components, pages, API integration. Follows existing patterns. |
| **Backend Sr.** | API Engineer | Endpoints, services, data models, migrations. TDD approach. |
| **UI/UX Sr.** | Designer | Screen specs, component trees, interaction flows. Design only. |
| **Security Sr.** | Security Auditor | OWASP Top 10, auth/RBAC, input validation. Reports — never fixes. |
| **QA Sr.** | Quality Engineer | Test strategy, unit/E2E/intent-based UI tests. Breaks things on purpose. |

### Why Separation Matters

| Principle | Single Agent | Agent Teams |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Self-review bias** | Same agent reviews its own code | Security Sr. + QA Sr. review independently |
| **Context window** | One context holds everything — overflow risk | Each agent has focused, relevant context |
| **Spec compliance** | No one checks if code matches requirements | CTO Lead validates requirement match rate |
| **API contract** | Frontend guesses backend shape | Frontend ↔ Backend negotiate via SendMessage |

## How It Works

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/workflow.svg" alt="Agent Teams Workflow" width="800"/>
</p>

### Phase 1 — Project Detection + Branch
Auto-detects your stack (Spring Boot, Nuxt, Next.js, Vite, Go, Rust, etc.) and creates a feature branch.

### Phase 2 — Team Formation + Planning
Spawns 6 agents as a real Claude Code Team (`TeamCreate`). Agents communicate via `SendMessage` to produce a collaborative plan.

### Phase 3 — Parallel Implementation
Frontend and Backend seniors work simultaneously. They negotiate API contracts in real time — no spec drift, no integration surprises.

### Phase 4 — Parallel Verification
4 checks run at once:
- Code review (Frontend + Backend)
- Security audit (OWASP Top 10)
- QA testing (Unit + E2E + Intent-based)
- Requirement match rate (CTO Lead)

### Phase 5-6 — Smart Commit + Push
Conventional Commits with logical splits. Each commit = one logical change. Then push or merge.

### Phase 7 — Cleanup
Kill dev servers, terminate workers, disband team. Clean exit.

## Quick Start

### Install

```bash
# 1. Add the Dev Squad marketplace
claude plugin marketplace add LeoHeo/dev-squad

# 2. Install the plugin
claude plugin install dev-squad
```

### Run

```bash
# Full feature development with Dev Squad
/new-feature

# Or use individual skills independently
/start-work      # Branch setup + project detection
/qa              # Intent-based UI QA testing
/test            # Run tests (auto-detects framework)
/build-all       # Build all projects
```

### First Run

1. `/new-feature` detects your project structure automatically
2. Enter your feature name and requirements
3. Watch 6 agents collaborate to build, review, and test your feature
4. Get a complete summary with commit-ready code

---

## Supported Stacks

Auto-detected from your project files. No configuration needed.

| Stack | Detection | Build | Test |
|-------|-----------|-------|------|
| **Spring Boot** (Gradle) | `build.gradle` + Spring deps | `./gradlew clean build` | `./gradlew test` |
| **Spring Boot** (Maven) | `pom.xml` + Spring deps | `./mvnw clean package` | `./mvnw test` |
| **Nuxt 3** | `nuxt.config.ts` | `npm run build` | `npm run test:unit` |
| **Next.js** | `next.config.*` | `npm run build` | `npm run test:unit` |
| **Vite** | `vite.config.*` | `npm run build` | `npm run test:unit` |
| **Go** | `go.mod` | `go build ./...` | `go test ./...` |
| **Rust** | `Cargo.toml` | `cargo build --release` | `cargo test` |
| **Node.js** | `package.json` | `npm run build` | `npm run test:unit` |

Monorepo? Dev Squad scans all subdirectories and handles each one by its type.

## Skills Reference

### `/new-feature` — Full Feature Development
The main skill. Runs all 7 phases with Dev Squad collaboration.

### `/start-work` — Environment Prep
Standalone branch setup:
- Detect project directories and types
- Handle uncommitted changes (stash / ignore / abort)
- Select base branch + create feature branch
- Generate `project-config.json`

### `/qa` — Intent-Based QA
Standalone QA testing:
- Auto-start dev servers if not running
- Run all scenarios or specific pages
- Auto-healing for failed UI steps (3-level)
- UX/UI improvement analysis

### `/test` — Framework-Aware Testing
Runs tests using the correct command for each project type.

### `/build-all` — Multi-Project Build
Builds all detected projects in sequence using type-appropriate commands.

## Customization

### Override Agents

Copy any agent from the plugin to your project's `.claude/agents/` directory and modify it. Project-level agents take priority over plugin agents.

```bash
# Example: customize the security review for your project
cp ~/.claude/plugins/cache/.../agents/security-senior.md .claude/agents/security-senior.md
# Edit to add project-specific security rules
```

### Project Config

The plugin generates `.claude/project-config.json` on first run:

```json
{
  "directories": [
    { "name": "backend", "path": "backend", "type": "spring-boot" },
    { "name": "frontend", "path": "frontend", "type": "nuxt" }
  ],
  "baseBranch": "master",
  "branchPrefix": "feature/"
}
```

Edit this file to customize branch strategy, exclude directories, or override detected types.

## FAQ

**Q: Why not just use one agent?**
A single agent reviewing its own code is like a chef tasting their own food — they already know what it *should* taste like. Dev Squad's Security Sr. and QA Sr. review code they didn't write, catching issues the author is blind to.

**Q: Does this actually speed things up?**
Frontend and Backend work in parallel, not sequentially. Verification (code review + security + QA + requirements) also runs in parallel. The wall-clock time drops significantly.

**Q: What if agents disagree?**
CTO Lead is the final arbiter. When Frontend Sr. and Backend Sr. negotiate API contracts via SendMessage, CTO Lead validates the result against requirements. Disagreements are resolved through the same message protocol.

**Q: Can I customize agent behavior?**
Yes. Copy any agent from the plugin to `.claude/agents/` and modify it. Project-level agents override plugin agents. See [Customization](#customization).

**Q: Do I need bkit installed?**
No. Dev Squad is fully independent. But bkit + Dev Squad together give you PDCA lifecycle management on top of multi-agent collaboration.

## Thanks To

> *If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.*

**[bkit (Vibecoding Kit)](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-plugins-official)** by POPUP STUDIO PTE. LTD.

Dev Squad wouldn't exist without bkit's pioneering PDCA methodology. Here's what bkit taught us:

- **"Plan first, code later"** — AI agents need structured phases, not ad-hoc prompting
- **The power of quality gates** — Verification at each stage is what guarantees output quality
- **Document-driven development** — Plan docs and QA scenarios should exist before code does

We took these lessons and added one more question: *What if each phase had its own specialist?*

bkit is licensed under Apache 2.0. Dev Squad works independently, but **bkit + Dev Squad together connect PDCA lifecycle management with multi-agent team collaboration.** Highly recommended.
